1. Question 1 of 12
You've saved $25,000 for a down payment on a house. 
You plan to buy within a year. Which of the following is the safest place to keep your money?
- In the safe in your house 
- Under the mattress 
- Stocks 
- Bank Savings Account 
- Government Bonds and Munis 

Here correct answer is 
You want money you plan to use within the next three to five years to be safe and easily accessible. Lock it up in a savings or money market account. You won't earn much interest on it with rates so low, but you also won't lose any of it to the volatility of the stock market.

3. Which investment offers the highest growth potential for your long-term goals?
- Keep stocking up gold 
- Treasury Bonds 
- Stocks 
- Money Market Bonds 
- Real Estate 

Correct Answer is: Stocks 
The stock market can be a roller coaster ride, 
but historically, stocks have fared best over the long run. 
And for long-term goals, you can generally afford to take on more risk in pursuit of a 
higher return because you have time to recover any short-term losses.

in good health and drives Tesla. Which insurance could he most likely do without?

A bank CD falls under federal protection if it's FDIC insured. That means up to $250,000 is protected in case a bank goes under, and you get up to $250,000 of insurance at each bank where you buy CDs. Municipal bonds, 
529 plans, 401(k)s and other investments are not covered. You invest at your own risk.
